- 👋 Hi, I’m @fakezii / Jamie. I am a 17-year-old college student from Tromsø, Norway studying game design in England and teaching myself some programming.
My main language is English, aber ich kann auch etwas Deutsch sprechen.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a programmer and getting my name out there as an indie gamedev.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Unity alongside C#. I'm interested in making music, art and animation as well.
